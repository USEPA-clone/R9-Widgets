# Wind Widget

This widget displays wind data for the entire planet that is generated by the <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/global-forcast-system-gfs">NOAA Global Forecast System</a>.  This data is obtained from <a href="http://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/">NOAA Operational Model Archive and Distribution System<a/> in a grib2 file format.

The grib2 files are converted to json utilizing the <a href="https://github.com/cambecc/grib2json">grib2json</a> tool.  The process_grib_files.py script we are using to harvest and convert these files can be found <a href="https://github.com/USEPA/R9-Python/tree/master/Wind">here</a>.

Once the files have benen harvested and converted you will need to update the url attribute of the esriRequest that loads the json file from the server.  At the time this was written, this can be found at line 39 of the Widget.js file.
 
```
vm.layersRequest = esriRequest({
  url: './widgets/Wind/wind_surface_level_gfs_1.0.json',
  content: {},
  handleAs: "json"
});
```

The code to actually display this data was obtained from a Esri demo project called <a href="https://github.com/Esri/wind-js">Wind-JS</a>.  This widget mainly serves as a wrapper to the Wind-JS code so the data can be displayed inside an Esri WAB.
