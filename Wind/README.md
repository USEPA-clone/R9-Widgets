# Smoke Widget

This widget displays wind data for the entire planet that is generated by the <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/global-forcast-system-gfs">NOAA Global Forecast System</a>.  This data is obtained from <a href="http://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/">NOAA Operational Model Archive and Distribution System<a/> in a grib2 file format.

The grib2 files are converted to json utilizing the <a href="https://github.com/cambecc/grib2json">grib2json</a> tool.  The process_grib_files.py script we are using to harvest and convert these files can be found <a href="https://github.com/USEPA/R9-Python/tree/master/Wind">here</a>.

Once the files have benen harvested and converted you will need to update the root_url attribute to point to the location of the hosted images. Each time the widget loads it will look for the latest images avilable based on the time stamps of the folders created by the harvesting script.  Additionally, the names of the files can not be changed as this is what the widget uses to determine the timestamp of the image.
