# Wind Widget

This widget displays wind data generated by the <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/global-forcast-system-gfs">NOAA Global Forecast System</a> for the entire planet.  The data is obtained from <a href="http://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/">NOAA Operational Model Archive and Distribution System<a/> in a grib2 file format.

The grib2 files are converted to json using the <a href="https://github.com/cambecc/grib2json">grib2json</a> tool. The process_grib_files.py script that harvests and converts these files can be found <a href="https://github.com/USEPA/R9-Python/tree/master/Wind">here</a>.

Once the files are harvested and converted, you will need to update the url attribute of the esriRequest that loads the json file from the server. At the time this script was written, this can be found at line 39 of the Widget.js file.
 
```
vm.layersRequest = esriRequest({
  url: './widgets/Wind/wind_surface_level_gfs_1.0.json',
  content: {},
  handleAs: "json"
});
```

The code to actually display this data was obtained from a Esri demo project called <a href="https://github.com/Esri/wind-js">Wind-JS</a>.  This widget primarily serves as a wrapper to the Wind-JS code so the data can be displayed inside an Esri WAB.
