# ESI Widget

Built around a NOAA web service, the Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) Widget is a custom JavaScript tool developed for US EPA Region 9. The widget is designed to compile all the data layers in the web service for a given point to provide a concise summary of coastal resources that are at risk if a spill occurs nearby. The related tables are nested inside of the widget panel. For example, for a given sea turtle species, the widget would display the nesting season, protected areas, and the contact information of the area manager.
