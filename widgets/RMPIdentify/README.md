# RMP Widget

The RMP Identify Widget is designed to display a subset the of the RMP data available for a selected site.  It does not display all available information in the RMP dataset.  Please use RMP*Review to obtain all available information about a given facility's RMP.

To configure the widget, first add the RMP map service to the map. Then, download a copy of this widget from <a href="https://github.com/USEPA/R9-Widgets/releases/tag/RMP_EB_v1">releases</a>. Place the widget in the `\client\R9-Widgets\widgets` folder of the Developer Edition of the ESRI Experience Builder. 

1) Navigate to the Insert Widget section of the Experience Builder Developer Edition.  
2) Place the widget box (2) in the location of the screen that you prefer.  The one in the image below is nested to the left in a Fixed Panel.  
3) Next, link the pane to the RMP Data by selecting the Map.  
4) Then, select the RMP Map Service (Layer).  
5) Select (and/or create) the button and click the "Set Link" button for the next step.
6) This widget works with a button configuration configured to a view.  The options in the image are the items to select for proper configuration. _The available views should line up with the Pane Section in the Outline (Table of Contents in the left panel of the EB Developer).  _
